Module Getopt::Long - extended processing of command line options
=================================================================

Getopt::Long is a standard Perl5 (core) module, but maintained
separately.

Note that this source tree contains a Makefile.PL (for Perl) and a
GNUmakefile (for development).

Relevant targets of the GNUmakefile are

* test : runs the standard tests

* regtest : runs the extended regression tests

* dist : creates a new tar.gz distribution

Note that a Github release is a snapshot of this repository. An
official CPAN release must be made with the 'dist' target of the
GNUmakefile.
